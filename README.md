## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Olympic Games data from Wikipedia to answer some questions:

1. Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games ?
2. Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts ?
3. Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count ?
4. Which are the top 5 countries if we weights each gold medal for 3 points, silver medals for 2 points, and bronze medals for 1 point ?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `olympics.csv` file that contains Olympic Games data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://amine13u.github.io/A-Data-Science-Blog-Post/).
